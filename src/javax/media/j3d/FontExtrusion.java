     * The FontExtrusion object is used to describe the extrusion path
     * for a Font3D object.  The extrusion path is used in conjunction
     * with a Font2D object.  The extrusion path defines the edge contour
     * of 3D text.  This contour is perpendicular to the face of the text.
     * The extrusion has it's origin at the edge of the glyph with 1.0 being
     * the height of the tallest glyph. Contour must be monotonic in x.
     * <P>
     * The shape of the extrusion path is, by default, a straight line
     * from 0.0 to 0.2 (known as a straight bevel). The shape may be
     * modified via the extrusionShape parameter, a Shape object that
     * describes the 3D contour of a Font3D object.
     * <P>
     * User is responsible for data sanity and must make sure that 
     * extrusionShape does not cause intersection of adjacent glyphs
     * or within single glyph. Else undefined output may be generated.
