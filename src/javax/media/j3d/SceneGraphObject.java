/**
 * SceneGraphObject is the common superclass for all scene graph
 * objects. Scene graph objects are classified into two main types:
 * nodes and node components. The Node object is the common superclass
 * of all nodes, which includes TransformGroup, Shape3D, etc.
 * The NodeComponent object is the common superclass of all node
 * components, which includes Geometry, Appearance, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * All scene graph objects have a name, a user data object, a set of
 * capability bits, and a set of capabilityIsFrequent bits.
 *
 * <p>
 * Capability bits control whether a particular attribute in a node or
 * node component is readable or writable. For live or compiled scene
 * graphs, only those attributes whose capabilities are set before the
 * scene graph is compiled or made live may be read or written. The
 * default value for all <i>read</i> capability bits is true, meaning
 * that all attributes may be read by default. The default value for
 * all <i>write</i> capability bits is false, meaning that no
 * attributes may be written by default. Read capability bits are
 * defined as those capability bits of the form <code>ALLOW_*_READ</code>,
 * plus the <code>ALLOW_INTERSECT</code> capability bit. Write
 * capability bits are defined as those capability bits of the form
 * <code>ALLOW_*_WRITE</code>, plus the <code>ALLOW_CHILDREN_EXTEND</code>
 * and <code>ALLOW_DETACH</code> capability bits.
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE that the <code>ENABLE_COLLISION_REPORTING</code> and
 * <code>ENABLE_PICK_REPORTING</code> bits are not really capability bits,
 * although they are set with the setCapability method. The default value
 * for each of the <code>ENABLE_*_REPORTING bits</code> is false.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more information, see the
 * <a href="doc-files/intro.html">Introduction to the Java 3D API</a>.
