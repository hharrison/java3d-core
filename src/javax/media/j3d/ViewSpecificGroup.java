/**
 * The ViewSpecificGroup node is a Group whose descendants are
 * rendered only on a specified set of views.  It
 * contains a list of views on which its descendants are
 * rendered.  Methods are provided to add, remove, and enumerate the
 * list of views.  The list of views is initially empty, meaning that
 * the descendants of this group will not be rendered on any view.  At
 * least one view must be added to the list of views for rendering to
 * occur.
 *
 * <p>
 * All nodes except ViewPlatform may appear as a descendant of
 * ViewSpecificGroup, including another ViewSpecificGroup.  If a
 * ViewSpecificGroup is a descendant of a ViewSpecificGroup, the
 * effect is to intersect the view sets of the ViewSpecificGroup nodes
 * in the hierarchy; each ViewSpecificGroup encountered when
 * traversing the scene graph further restricts the set of views on
 * which its descendants are rendered.  More formally, descendant
 * nodes of ViewSpecificGroups are rendered in (or apply to) only
 * those views that are contained in the set of views of every
 * ViewSpecificGroup in the scene graph path from the Locale to the
 * Node.
 *
 * <p>
 * Behavior
 * nodes may appear under a ViewSpecificGroup, but are not affected by
 * it--the Behavior scheduler is per-universe rather than per-View.
 * BoundingLeaf nodes are similarly unaffected by being under a
 * ViewSpecificGroup.  A BoundingLeaf under a ViewSpecificGroup
 * provides a valid bounds for any node that refers to it,
 * irrespective of the view.
 *
 * <p>
 * The rest of the leaf nodes either: A) are only rendered within the
 * specified view(s), for example, Shape3D, Morph, and Sound; or B)
 * only affect other objects when they are rendered in the specified
 * view(s), for example, AlternateAppearance, Clip, ModelClip, Fog,
 * Light, Soundscape, Background.
