/**
 * The ConeSound node object defines a PointSound node whose sound source is
 * directed along a specific vector in space. A ConeSound source is attenuated
 * by gain scale factors and filters based on the angle between the vector from
 * the source to the listener, and the ConeSound's direction vector. This
 * attenuation is either a single spherical distance gain attenuation (as for
 * a general PointSound source) or dual front and back distance gain 
 * attenuations defining elliptical attenuation areas. The angular filter and the
 * active AuralAttribute component filter define what filtering is applied to
 * the sound source. (See AuralAtttribute class for more details on filtering.)
 * This node has the same attributes as a PointSound node with the addition of a
 * direction vector and an array of points each containing: angular distance (in
 * radians), gain scale factor, and filter (which for now consists of a lowpass
 * filter cutoff frequency). Similar to the definition of the back distance gain
 * array for PointSounds, a piece-wise linear curve (defined in terms of 
 * radians from the axis) specifies the slope of these additional attenuation
 * values.
 *   <P>
 *  Distance Gain attuation
 *   <P><UL>
 * A cone sound node can have one or two distance attenuation arrays.
 * If none are set, no distance gain attenuation is performed (equivalent
 * to using a distance gain of 1.0 for all distances). If only one distance
 * attenuation array is set, sphere attenuation is assumed. If both a front
 * and back distance attenuation are set, elliptical attenuation regions
 * are defined.
 *<P>
 * Use PointSound setDistanceGain() method to set the front distance
 * attenuation array separate from the back distance attenuation array.
 * A front distance attenuation array defines monotonically-increasing
 * distances from the sound source origin along the position direction
 * vector. A back distance attenuation array (if given) defines 
 * monotonically-increasing distances from the sound source origin along the
 * negative direction vector. The two arrays must be of the same length.
 * The backDistance[i] gain values must be less than or equal to
 * the frontDistance[i] gain values.
 * <P>
 * Gain scale factors are associated with distances from the listener to
 * the sound source via an array of (distance, gain-scale-factor) pairs.
 * The gain scale factor applied to the sound source is the linear
 * interpolated gain value between the distance value range that includes
 * the current distance from the listener to the sound source.
 *<P>
 * The getDistanceGainLength method defined for PointSound returns the length
 * of the all distance gain attenuation arrays, including the back distance
 * gain arrays.  Arrays passed into getDistanceGain methods should all
 * be at least this size.
 *  </UL> <P>
 *  Direction Methods
 *   <P><UL>
 * This value is the sound source's direction vector. It is the axis from
 * which angular distance is measured.
 * </UL><P>
 *  Angular Attenuation
 *   <P><UL>
 * Besides sound (linear) distance attenuation a ConeSound can optionally
 * define angular gain and filter attenuation.
 *   <P>
 * This attenuation is defined
 * as a triple of (angular distance, gain-scale-factor, filter). The
 * distance is measured as the angle in radians between the ConeSound's
 * direction vector and the vector from the sound source position to the
 * listener. Both the gain scale factor and filter applied to the sound
 * source is the linear interpolation of values between the distance value
 * range that includes the angular distance from the sound source axis.
 *<P>
 * If this is not set, no angular gain attenuation or filtering is performed
 * (equivalent to using an angular gain scale factor of 1.0 and an angular
 * filter of Sound.NO_FILTER for all distances). 
 *   <P>
 * If angular distance from the listener-sound-position vector and a sound's
 * direction vector is less than the first distance in the array, only the first
 * gain scale factor and first filter are applied to the sound source.
 * This creates a conical region around the listener within which the sound
 * is uniformly attenuated by first gain and first filter in the array.
 *   <P>
 * If the distance from the listener-sound-position vector and the sound's
 * direction vector is greater than the last distance in the array, the last gain
 * scale factor and last filter are applied to the sound source.
 *   <P>
 * Distance elements in this array of points is a monotonically-increasing
 * set of floating point numbers measured from 0 to p radians. Gain scale
 * factors elements in this list of points can be any positive floating
 * point numbers.  While for most applications this list of gain scale
 * factors will usually be monotonically-decreasing, they do not have to be.
 * The filter (for now) is a single simple frequency cutoff value.
 *   <P>
 * The getAngularAttenuationArrayLength method returns the length of the angular
 * attenuation arrays. Arrays passed into getAngularAttenuation methods
 * should all be at least this size.
 *</UL>
