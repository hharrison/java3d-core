/**
 * The ShaderAttributeObject class is an abstract class that
 * encapsulates a uniform shader attribute whose value is specified
 * explicitly. This class has concrete subclasses for single-value
 * attributes (ShaderAttributeValue) and array attributes
 * (ShaderAttributeArray). The shader variable <code>attrName</code>
 * is explicitly set to the specified <code>value</code> during
 * rendering. <code>attrName</code> must be the name of a valid
 * uniform attribute in the shader in which it is used. Otherwise, the
 * attribute name will be ignored and a runtime error may be
 * generated. The <code>value</code> must be an instance of one of the
 * allowed classes or an array of one the allowed classes. The allowed
 * classes are: <code>Integer</code>, <code>Float</code>,
 * <code>Tuple{2,3,4}{i,f}</code>,
 * <code>Matrix{3,4}f</code>. A ClassCastException will be thrown
 * if a specified <code>value</code> object is not one of the allowed
 * types. Further, the type of the value is immutable once a
 * ShaderAttributeObject is constructed.  Subsequent setValue
 * operations must be called with an object of the same type as the
 * one that was used to construct the ShaderAttributeObject. Finally,
 * the type of the <code>value</code> object must match the type of
 * the corresponding <code>attrName</code> variable in the shader in
 * which it is used. Otherwise, the shader will not be able to use the
 * attribute and a runtime error may be generated.
