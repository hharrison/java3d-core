/**
 * The ShaderAttributeBinding object encapsulates a uniform attribute
 * whose value is bound to a Java&nbsp;3D system attribute. The
 * shader variable <code>attrName</code> is implicitly set to the
 * value of the corresponding Java&nbsp;3D system attribute
 * <code>j3dAttrName</code> during rendering. <code>attrName</code>
 * must be the name of a valid uniform attribute in the shader in
 * which it is used. Otherwise, the attribute name will be ignored and
 * a runtime error may be generated. <code>j3dAttrName</code> must be
 * the name of a predefined Java&nbsp;3D system attribute. An
 * IllegalArgumentException will be thrown if the specified
 * <code>j3dAttrName</code> is not one of the predefined system
 * attributes. Further, the type of the <code>j3dAttrName</code>
 * attribute must match the type of the corresponding
 * <code>attrName</code> variable in the shader in which it is
 * used. Otherwise, the shader will not be able to use the attribute
 * and a runtime error may be generated.
