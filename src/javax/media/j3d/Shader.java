/**
 * The Shader object is the abstract base class for programmable
 * shader code. Currently, only text-based source code shaders are
 * supported, so the only subclass of Shader is SourceCodeShader. We
 * leave open the possibility for binary (object code) shaders in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each instance of a Shader object allows an application to specify
 * the source code used in programming the Graphics Pipeline Unit
 * (GPU) of the graphics accelerator. A Shader object is constructed
 * with modes that specify the <i>shading language</i> and the
 * <i>shader type</i>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The shading language specifies the language and runtime environment
 * used to program the GPU. The currently defined shading languages
 * are GLSL (also known as the OpenGL 2.0 shading language) and
 * Cg. Note that not all shading languages are supported on all
 * platforms. It is up to the application or utility to query whether
 * a particular shading language is supported before using it. The
 * value of the <code>shadingLanguage</code> mode is one of:
 * <code>SHADING_LANGUAGE_GLSL</code> or
 * <code>SHADING_LANGUAGE_CG</code>.
 *
 *<p>
 * The shader type specifies whether the shader is a <i>vertex
 * shader</i> or a <i>fragment shader</i>. A vertex shader replaces
 * the fixed-function graphics pipeline for vertex operations
 * (transformation and lighting). A fragment shader replaces the
 * fixed-function graphics pipeline for fragment shading operations
 * (texture mapping, texture application, coloring, shading, and so
 * forth). The value of the <code>shaderType</code> mode is one of:
 * <code>SHADER_TYPE_VERTEX</code> or
 * <code>SHADER_TYPE_FRAGMENT</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Both the shading language and shader type are immutable modes of
 * the Shader object.
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Applications should <i>not</i> extend this class.
 *
 * @see ShaderProgram
 * @see Canvas3D#isShadingLanguageSupported

 * @since Java 3D 1.4
