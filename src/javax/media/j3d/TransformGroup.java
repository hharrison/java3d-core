/**
 * Group node that contains a transform. The TransformGroup node 
 * specifies a single spatial transformation, via a Transform3D
 * object, that can position, orient, and scale all of its children.
 * <P>
 * The specified transformation must be affine. Further, if the 
 * TransformGroup node is used as an ancestor of a ViewPlatform node 
 * in the scene graph, the transformation must be congruent-only 
 * rotations, translations, and uniform scales are allowed in
 * a direct path from a Locale to a ViewPlatform node.
 * <P>
 * Note: Even though arbitrary affine transformations are
 * allowed, better performance will result if all matrices
 * within a branch graph are congruent, containing only rotations
 * translation, and uniform scale.
 * <P>
 * The effects of transformations in the scene graph are cumulative. 
 * The concatenation of the transformations of each TransformGroup in 
 * a direct path from the Locale to a Leaf node defines a composite 
 * model transformation (CMT) that takes points in that Leaf node's 
 * local coordinates and transforms them into Virtual World (Vworld) 
 * coordinates. This composite transformation is used to
 * transform points, normals, and distances into Vworld coordinates. 
 * Points are transformed by the CMT. Normals are transformed by the 
 * inverse-transpose of the CMT. Distances are transformed by the scale 
 * of the CMT. In the case of a transformation containing a nonuniform 
 * scale or shear, the maximum scale value in
 * any direction is used. This ensures, for example, that a transformed 
 * bounding sphere, which is specified as a point and a radius, 
 * continues to enclose all objects that are also transformed using 
 * a nonuniform scale.
 * <P>
