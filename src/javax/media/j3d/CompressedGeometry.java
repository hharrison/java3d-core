/**
 * The compressed geometry object is used to store geometry in a
 * compressed format. Using compressed geometry may increase the speed
 * objects can be sent over the network. Note that the geometry will
 * be decompressed in memory, so the application will not see any
 * memory savings.
 * <p>
 * Compressed geometry may be passed to this CompressedGeometry object
 * in one of two ways: by copying the data into this object using the
 * existing constructor, or by passing a reference to the data.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>By Copying:</b>
 * The existing CompressedGeometry constructor copies the buffer of
 * compressed geometry data into this CompressedGeometry object.  This
 * is appropriate for many applications, and allows Java 3D to verify
 * the data once and then not worry about it again.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>By Reference:</b>
 * A new constructor and set of methods in Java 3D version 1.2 allows
 * compressed geometry data to be accessed by reference, directly from
 * the user's array.  To use this feature, you need to construct a
 * CompressedGeometry object with the <code>byReference</code> flag
 * set to <code>true</code>.  In this mode, a reference to the input
 * data is saved, but the data itself is not necessarily copied.  Note
 * that the compressed geometry header is still copied into this
 * compressed geometry object.  Data referenced by a
 * CompressedGeometry object must not be modified after the
 * CompressedGeometry object is constructed.
 * Applications
 * must exercise care not to violate this rule.  If any referenced
 * compressed geometry data is modified after construction,
 * the results are undefined.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @deprecated As of Java 3D version 1.4.
