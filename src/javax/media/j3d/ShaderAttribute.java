/**
 * The ShaderAttribute object encapsulates a uniform attribute for a
 * shader programs.  Uniform attributes (variables) are those
 * attributes whose values are constant during the rendering of a
 * primitive. Their values may change from primitive to primitive, but
 * are constant for each vertex (for vertex shaders) or fragment (for
 * fragment shaders) of a single primitive. Examples of uniform
 * attributes include a transformation matrix, a texture map, lights,
 * lookup tables, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two ways in which values can be specified for uniform
 * attributes: explicitly, by providing a value; and implicitly, by
 * defining a binding between a Java 3D system attribute and a uniform
 * attribute. This functionality is provided by two subclasses of
 * ShaderAttribute as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>ShaderAttributeObject, in which attributes are expressed as
 * <code>(attrName,&nbsp;value)</code> pairs, is used for explicitly
 * defined attributes</li>
 * <li>ShaderAttributeBinding, in which attributes are expressed as
 * <code>(attrName,&nbsp;j3dAttrName)</code> pairs, is used for
 * implicitly defined, automatically tracked attributes</li>
 * </ul>
