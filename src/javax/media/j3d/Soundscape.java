/**
 * The Soundscape Leaf Node defines the attributes that characterize the
 * listener's environment as it pertains to sound. This node defines an
 * application region and an associated aural attribute component object
 * that controls reverberation and atmospheric properties that affect sound
 * source rendering. Multiple Soundscape nodes can be included in a single
 * scene graph.
 *  <P>
 * The Soundscape application region, different from a Sound node's scheduling
 * region, is used to select which Soundscape (and thus which aural attribute
 * object) is to be applied to the sounds being rendered. This selection is
 * based on the position of the ViewPlatform (i.e., the listener), not the
 * position of the sound.
 *  <P>
 * It will be common that multiple Soundscape regions are contained within a
 * scene graph. For example, two Soundscape regions within a single space the
 * listener can move about: a region with a large open area on the right, and
 * a smaller more constricted, less reverberant area on the left.  The rever-
 * beration attributes for these two regions could be set to approximate their
 * physical differences so that active sounds are rendered differently depending
 * on which region the listener is in.
