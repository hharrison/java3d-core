/**
 * The PointSound node (a sub-class of the Sound node) defines a spatially 
 * located sound source whose waves radiate uniformly in all directions from 
 * a given location in space.  It has the same attributes as a Sound object
 * with the addition of a location and the specification of distance-based
 * gain attenuation for listener positions between an array of distances.
 *<P>
 * A sound's amplitude is attenuated based on the distance between the listener
 * and the sound source position. A piecewise linear curve (defined in terms of
 * pairs of distance and gain scale factor) specifies the gain scale factor slope.
 * 
 * The PointSound's location and attenuation distances are defined in the local
 * coordinate system of the node.
 *<P>
 *  Distance Gain Attenuation
 * <UL>
 * Associated with distances from the listener to the sound source via an
 * array of (distance, gain-scale-factor) pairs. The gain scale factor
 * applied to the sound source is the linear interpolated gain value between
 * the distance value range that includes the current distance from 
 * the listener to the sound source. If the distance from the listener to
 * the sound source is less than the first distance in the array, the first
 * gain scale factor is applied to the sound source. This creates a
 * spherical region around the listener within which all sound gain is
 * uniformly scaled by the first gain in the array.  If the distance from
 * the listener to the sound source is greater than the last distance in
 * the array, the last gain scale factor is applied to the sound source.
 *<P>
 * Distance elements in this array of Point2f is a monotonically-increasing
 * set of floating point numbers measured from the location of the sound
 * source. Gain scale factors elements in this list of pairs can be any
 * positive floating point numbers. While for most applications this list
 * of gain scale factors will usually be monotonically-decreasing, they
 * do not have to be.
 * If this 
 * is not set, no distance gain attenuation is performed (equivalent to 
 * using a distance gain of 1.0 for all distances). 
 *<P>
 * getDistanceGainLength method returns the length of the distance gain
 * attenuation arrays. Arrays passed into getDistanceGain methods should all
 * be at least this size.
 *<P>
 * There are two methods for getDistanceGain, one returning an array of
 * points, the other returning separate arrays for each attenuation 
 * component.</UL>
