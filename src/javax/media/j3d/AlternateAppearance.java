/**
 * The AlternateAppearance leaf node is used for overriding the
 * Appearance component of selected nodes.  It defines an Appearance
 * component object and a region of influence in which this
 * AlternateAppearance node is active.  An AlternateAppearance node
 * also contains a list of Group nodes that specifies the hierarchical
 * scope of this AlternateAppearance.  If the scope list is empty,
 * then the AlternateAppearance node has universe scope: all nodes
 * within the region of influence are affected by this
 * AlternateAppearance node.  If the scope list is non-empty, then
 * only those Leaf nodes under the Group nodes in the scope list are
 * affected by this AlternateAppearance node (subject to the
 * influencing bounds).
 *
 * <p>
 * An AlternateAppearance node affects Shape3D and Morph nodes by
 * overriding their appearance component with the appearance
 * component in this AlternateAppearance node.  Only those Shape3D and
 * Morph nodes that explicitly allow their appearance to be
 * overridden are affected.  The AlternateAppearance node has no
 * effect on Shape3D and Morph nodes that do not allow their
 * appearance to be overridden.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the regions of influence of multiple AlternateAppearance nodes
 * overlap, the Java 3D system will choose a single alternate
 * appearance for those objects that lie in the intersection.  This is
 * done in an implementation-dependent manner, but in general, the
 * AlternateAppearance node that is "closest" to the object is chosen.
 *
