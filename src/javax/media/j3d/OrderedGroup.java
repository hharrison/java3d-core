/**
 * The OrderedGroup node is a Group that ensures its children render
 * in a specified order.  In addition to the list of children
 * inherited from the base Group class, OrderedGroup defines an
 * integer array of child indices that specify the order in which its
 * children are rendered.  This provides a level of indirection in
 * determining the rendering order of its children.  By default, the
 * child index order array is null, and the children are rendered in
 * increasing index order.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the child index order array is non-null, it must be the same
 * length as the number of children.  Every entry in the array must
 * have a unique value between 0 and <code>numChildren-1</code> (i.e.,
 * there must be no duplicate values and no missing indices).  The
 * order that the child indices appear in the child index order array
 * determines the order in which the children are rendered.  The child
 * at <code>childIndexOrder[0]</code> is rendered first, followed by
 * <code>childIndexOrder[1]</code>, and so on, with the child at
 * <code>childIndexOrder[numChildren-1]</code> rendered
 * last.
 *
 * <p>
 * The child index order array only affects rendering.  List
 * operations that refer to a child by index, such as getChild(index),
 * will not be altered by the entries in this array.  They will get,
 * enumerate, add, remove, etc., the children based on the actual
 * index in the group node.  However, some of the list operations,
 * such as addChild, removeChild, etc., will update the child index
 * order array as a result of their operation.  For example,
 * removeChild will remove the entry in the child index order array
 * corresponding to the removed child's index and adjust the remaining
 * entries accordingly.  See the documentation for these methods for
 * more details.
