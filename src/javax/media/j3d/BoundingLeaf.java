/**
 * The BoundingLeaf node defines a bounding region object that can be
 * referenced by other nodes to define a region of influence 
 * (Fog and Light nodes), an application region (Background, Clip,
 * and Soundscape nodes), or a scheduling region (Sound and
 * Behavior nodes). The bounding region is defined in the local
 * coordinate system of the BoundingLeaf node. A reference to a
 * BoundingLeaf node can be used in place
 * of a locally defined bounds object for any of the aforementioned regions.
 * <P>
 * This allows an application to specify a bounding region in one coordinate system
 * (the local coordinate system of the BoundingLeaf node) other than the local
 * coordinate system of the node that references the bounds. For an example of how
 * this might be used, consider a closed room with a number of track lights. Each
 * light can move independent of the other lights and, as such, needs its own local
 * coordinate system. However, the bounding volume is used by all the lights in the
 * boundary of the room, which doesn't move when the lights move. In this example,
 * the BoundingLeaf node allows the bounding region to be defined in the local
 * coordinate system of the room, rather than in the local coordinate system of a
 * particular light. All lights can then share this single bounding volume.
