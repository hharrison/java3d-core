/**
 * The Sensor Class encapsulates an object that provides real-time
 * data.  Examples include six-degree-of-freedom tracking, a joystick,
 * or a data file being read back during a program.  A sensor must be
 * used in conjuction with an implementation of the InputDevice
 * interface.<P> 
 * 
 * The Sensor object provides an abstract concept of a hardware
 * input device. A Sensor consists of a timestamped sequence of
 * input values and the state of buttons or switches at the time
 * that Java 3D sampled the value. A sensor also contains a hotspot
 * offset specified in the sensor's local coordinate system. If not
 * specified, the hotspot is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).<P>
 *
 * Since a typical hardware environment may contain multiple sensing
 * elements, Java 3D maintains an array of sensors. Users can access
 * a sensor directly from their Java code or they can assign a sensor
 * to one of Java 3D's predefined 6DOF entities, such as UserHead.<P>
 *
 * Using a sensor is as easy as accessing an object. Write your
 * Java code to extract the associated sensor value from the array of
 * sensors. You can then directly apply that value to an element in a
 * scene graph or process the sensor values in whatever way necessary.<P>
 *
 * Java 3D includes three special six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) entities.
 * These include UserHead, DominantHand, and NondominantHand. You
 * can assign or change which sensor drives one
 * of these predefined entities. Java 3D uses the specified sensor to 
 * drive the 6DOF entity - most visibly the View.<P>
 *
 * Java 3D does not provide raw tracker or joystick-generated data in 
 * a sensor. At a minimum, Java 3D normalizes the raw data using the 
 * registration and calibration parameters either provided by or 
 * provided for the end user. It additionally may filter and process 
 * the data to remove noise and improve latency.
 * The application programmer can suppress this latter effect on a 
 * sensor-by-sensor basis.<P>
