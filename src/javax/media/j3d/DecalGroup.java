/**
 * The DecalGroup node is an ordered group node used for defining decal
 * geometry on top of other geometry. The DecalGroup node specifies that
 * its children should be rendered in index order and that they generate
 * coplanar objects. Examples of this include: painted decals or text on
 * surfaces, a checkerboard layered on top of a table, etc.
 * <p>
 * The first child, at index 0, defines the surface on top of which all
 * other children are rendered. The geometry of this child must encompass
 * all other children, otherwise incorrect rendering may result. The
 * polygons contained within each of the children must be facing the same
 * way. If the polygons defined by the first child are front facing, then
 * all other surfaces should be front facing. In this case, the polygons
 * are rendered in order. The renderer can use knowledge of the coplanar
 * nature of the surfaces to avoid
 * Z-buffer collisions. If the main surface is back facing then all other
 * surfaces should be back facing, and need not be rendered (even if back
 * face culling is disabled).
 * <p>
 * Note that using the DecalGroup node does not guarantee that Z-buffer
 * collisions are avoided. An implementation of Java 3D may fall back to
 * treating DecalGroup node as an OrderedGroup node.
