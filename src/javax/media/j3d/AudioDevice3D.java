/**
 * The AudioDevice3D class defines a 3D audio device that is used to set
 * sound and aural attributes.
 *<P>
 * After the application chooses the AudioDevice3D that Java3D sound
 * is to be rendered on, the Java 3D Sound Scheduler will call these
 * methods for all active sounds to render them on the audio device.
 *<P>
 * The intent is for this interface to be implemented by AudioDevice Driver
 * developers using a software or hardware sound engine of their choice.
 *<P>
 * Methods in this interface provide the Java3D Core a generic way to
 * set and query the audio device the application has chosen audio rendering
 * to be performed on.  Methods in this interface include:
 * <UL>
 *    Set up and clear the sound as a sample on the device.
 * <P>
 *    Start, stop, pause, unpause, mute, and unmute of sample on the device.
 * <P>
 *    Set parameters for each sample corresponding to the fields in the 
 *    Sound node.
 * <P>
 *    Set the current active aural parameters that affect all positional samples.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * Sound Types
 * <P>
 * Sound types match the Sound node classes defined for Java 3D core
 * for BackgroundSound, PointSound, and ConeSound.  The type of sound
 * a sample is loaded as determines which methods affect it.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Sound Data Types
 * <P>
 * Samples can be processed as streaming or buffered data.
 * Fully spatializing sound sources may require data to be buffered.
