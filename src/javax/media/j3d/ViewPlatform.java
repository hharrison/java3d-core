/**
 * The ViewPlatform leaf node object controls the position, orientation
 * and scale of the viewer.  It is the node in the scene graph that a
 * View object connects to. A viewer navigates through the virtual 
 * universe by changing the transform in the scene graph hierarchy above 
 * the ViewPlatform.
 * <p>
 * <b>The View Attach Policy</b>
 * <p>
 * The actual view that Java 3D's renderer draws depends on the view
 * attach policy specified within the currently attached ViewPlatform.
 * The view attach policy, set by the setViewAttachPolicy
 * method, is one of the following:
 * <p>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>View.NOMINAL_HEAD - ensures that the end-user's nominal eye
 * position in the physical world corresponds to the virtual eye's
 * nominal eye position in the virtual world (the ViewPlatform's origin).
 * In essence, this policy tells Java 3D to position the virtual eyepoint
 * relative to the ViewPlatform origin in the same way as the physical
 * eyepoint is positioned relative to its nominal physical-world
 * origin. Deviations in the physical eye's position and orientation from
 * nominal in the physical world generate corresponding deviations of the
 * virtual eye's position and orientation in the virtual world. This
 * is the default view attach policy.</LI>
 * <p>
 * <LI>View.NOMINAL_FEET - ensures that the end-user's virtual feet
 * always touch the virtual ground. This policy tells Java 3D to compute
 * the physical-to-virtual-world correspondence in a way that enforces
 * this constraint. Java 3D does so by appropriately offsetting the
 * physical eye's position by the end-user's physical height. Java 3D
 * uses the nominalEyeHeightFromGround parameter found in the
 * PhysicalBody object to perform this computation.</LI>
 * <p>
 * <LI>View.NOMINAL_SCREEN - allows an application to always have
 * the virtual eyepoint appear at some "viewable" distance from a point
 * of interest. This policy tells Java 3D to compute the
 * physical-to-virtual-world correspondence in a way
 * that ensures that the renderer moves the nominal virtual eyepoint
 * away from the point of interest by the amount specified by the
 * nominalEyeOffsetFromNominalScreen parameter found in the
 * PhysicalBody object.</LI></UL>
 * <p>
 * <b>Activation Radius</b>
 * <p>
 * The ViewPlatform's activation radius defines an activation
 * volume surrounding the center of the ViewPlatform. This activation
 * volume is a spherical region that intersects with the scheduling regions 
 * and application regions
 * of other leaf node objects to determine which of those objects may
 * affect rendering.  Only active view platforms--that is, view platforms
 * attached to a View--will be used to schedule or select other leaf nodes.
 * <p>
 * Different leaf objects interact with the ViewPlatform's activation
 * volume differently. The Background, Clip, and Soundscape leaf objects
 * each define a set of attributes and an application region in which
 * those attributes are applied. If more than one node of a given type
 * (Background, Clip, or Soundscape) intersects an active ViewPlatform's
 * activation volume, the "most appropriate" node is selected for that View.
 * Sound leaf objects and Behavior objects become active when
 * their scheduling region intersects an active ViewPlatform's activation 
 * volume. 
 * <p>
 * The activation radius is in view platform coordinates. For the
 * default screen scale policy of SCALE_SCREEN_SIZE, the 
 * activationRadius parameter value is multiplied by half the 
 * monitor screen size to derive the actual activation radius. For example,
 * for the default screen size of 0.35 meters, and the default activation
 * radius value of 62, the actual activation radius would be 10.85
 * meters.
 * <p>
 * <UL>
 * <code>62 * 0.35 / 2 = 10.85</code>
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 *
 * @see View
