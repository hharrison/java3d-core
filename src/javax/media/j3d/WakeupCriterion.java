 * An abstract class specifying a singleton wakeup Criterion. This
 * class consists of several subclasses, each of which specifies one
 * particular wakeup criterion, that criterion's associated arguments 
 * (if any), and either a flag that indicates whether this criterion 
 * caused a Behavior object to awaken or a return field containing the 
 * information that caused the Behavior object to awaken.
 * <p>
 * Note that a unique WakeupCriterion object must be used with each instance
 * of a Behavior. Sharing wakeup criteria among different instances of
 * a Behavior is illegal.  Similarly, a unique WakeupCriterion object
 * must be used for each individual element in the set of arrays used
 * to construct WakeupOr, WakeupAnd, WakeupOrOfAnds, and
 * WakeupAndOfOrs objects.
