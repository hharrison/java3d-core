 * The SharedGroup provides the ability to manipulate an

 * A SharedGroup node allows multiple Link leaf nodes to share its
 * subgraph according to the following semantics:
 * <P><UL>
 * <LI>A SharedGroup may be referenced by one or more Link leaf
 * nodes. Any runtime changes to a node or component object in this
 * shared subgraph affect all graphs that refer to this subgraph.</LI><P>
 *
 * <LI>A SharedGroup may be compiled by calling its compile method
 * prior to being referenced by any Link leaf nodes.</LI><P>
 *
 * <LI>Only Link leaf nodes may refer to SharedGroup nodes. A
 * SharedGroup node cannot have parents or be attached to a Locale.</LI><P>
 * </UL>
 *
 * A shared subgraph may contain any group node, except an embedded
 * SharedGroup node (SharedGroup nodes cannot have parents). However,
 * only the following leaf nodes may appear in a shared subgraph:
 * <P><UL>
 * <LI>Light</LI>
 * <LI>Link</LI>
 * <LI>Morph</LI>
 * <LI>Shape</LI>
 * <LI>Sound</LI></UL><P>
