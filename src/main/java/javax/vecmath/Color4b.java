/**
 * A four-byte color value represented by byte x, y, z, and w values. 
 * The x, y, z, and w values represent the red, green, blue, and alpha
 * values, respectively.
 * <p>
 * Note that Java defines a byte as a signed integer in the range
 * [-128, 127]. However, colors are more typically represented by values
 * in the range [0, 255]. Java 3D recognizes this and for color
 * treats the bytes as if the range were [0, 255]---in other words, as
 * if the bytes were unsigned.
 * <p>
 * Java 3D assumes that a linear (gamma-corrected) visual is used for
 * all colors.
