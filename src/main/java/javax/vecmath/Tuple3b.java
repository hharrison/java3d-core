/**
 * A three byte tuple.  Note that Java defines a byte as a signed integer
 * in the range [-128, 127]. However, colors are more typically
 * represented by values in the range [0, 255]. Java 3D recognizes this
 * and, in those cases where Tuple3b is used to represent color, treats
 * the bytes as if the range were [0, 255]---in other words, as if the
 * bytes were unsigned.
 * Values greater than 127 can be assigned to a byte variable using a
 * type cast.  For example:
 * <ul>byteVariable = (byte) intValue; // intValue can be > 127</ul>
 * If intValue is greater than 127, then byteVariable will be negative.  The
 * correct value will be extracted when it is used (by masking off the upper
 * bits).
