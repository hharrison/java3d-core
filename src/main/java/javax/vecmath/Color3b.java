/**
 * A three-byte color value represented by byte x, y, and z values. The

 * <p>
 * Note that Java defines a byte as a signed integer in the range
 * [-128, 127]. However, colors are more typically represented by values 
 * in the range [0, 255]. Java 3D recognizes this and for color
 * treats the bytes as if the range were [0, 255]---in other words, as
 * if the bytes were unsigned.

 * Java 3D assumes that a linear (gamma-corrected) visual is used for
 * all colors.
