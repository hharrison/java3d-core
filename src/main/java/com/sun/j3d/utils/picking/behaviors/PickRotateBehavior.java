/**
 * A mouse behavior that allows user to pick and drag scene graph objects.

 * <p>
 * 1. Create your scene graph.

 * 2. Create this behavior with root and canvas.
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *	PickRotateBehavior behavior = new PickRotateBehavior(canvas, root, bounds);
 *      root.addChild(behavior);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The above behavior will monitor for any picking events on
 * the scene graph (below root node) and handle mouse drags on pick hits.
 * Note the root node can also be a subgraph node of the scene graph (rather
 * than the topmost).
