<p>This project contains the source code
for the core Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API
package, <code>javax.media.j3d</code>.</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="https://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), <a
 href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and <a
 href="https://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D
example programs). The vecmath and j3d-core-utils projects are required
to build j3d-core. Developers should refer to the <a
 href="build-instr.html">CVS download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading the source code and
building j3d-core.<br>

<p>Java&nbsp;3D is also licensed for commercial use under a new
no-fee <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/jdl-java3d.pdf"

allows commercial use of Java&nbsp;3D with or without modification, as
long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained.
This includes passing the TCK tests for Java&nbsp;3D, and retaining the
javax namespace as defined by the JCP.
</p>
<p>
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community participation, and
encourage developers to contribute both bug fixes and new
implementation code to the API. The combination of the JRL and the JDL
was chosen to facilitate this, while ensuring the integrity and
compatibility of the API.<br>
